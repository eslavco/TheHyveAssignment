# TheHyveAssignment


The program receives, on standard input, an encoded data stream. 

The program outputs: 
* to standard output, the decoded binary data. If any invalid or incomplete
pair is found, the byte 3F should be output in its place.

* To standard error, the result of re-encoding the decoded data produced in the above step ( trivial one that always uses pi = 0 and a better one that produces an short output)
